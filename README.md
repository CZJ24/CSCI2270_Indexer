## Introduction

In this project, we construct a Virtual IP Network using UDP as the link layer. The network will support dynamic routing. Each node will be configured with its (virtual) links at startup and support the activation and deactivation of those links at run time. We build a simple routing protocol over these links to dynamically update the nodesâ€™ routing tables so that they can communicate over the virtual topology
